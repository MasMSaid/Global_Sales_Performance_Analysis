## 📝 Overview
This project is part of my **Adnexio Data Science Bootcamp** capstone project, where the goal was to analyze a financial dataset and present meaningful insights through a Tableau visualization.  

The dashboard provides an **interactive analysis of global sales and profit trends** across countries and products, helping stakeholders quickly identify high-performing areas and opportunities for improvement.


## 🔍 Key Questions
- Which countries and products generate the highest sales & profit?  
- Are there trends over time indicating growth or decline?  
- Which products underperform?  
- How do discounts influence sales across different countries and products?  


## 🛠️ Tools

- Tableau Desktop/Public

- **KPI Cards:**  
  The dashboard includes **three KPI cards** displaying **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, and **Profit Margin** at a glance. These provide a quick overview of overall performance and profitability.

- **1️⃣ Sales by Country (Vertical Bar Chart):**  
  Highlights total sales for each country, making it easy to identify top-performing markets.

- **2️⃣ Units Sold & Discounts by Date and Cluster (Scatter Plot):**  
  Visualizes **sum of units sold** versus **sum of discounts** over time, segmented by cluster.  
  - Shows which clusters respond more to discounts and which maintain consistent sales.  

- **3️⃣ Sales & Profit by Product (TreeMap):**  
  Displays **sum of sales and sum of profit** for individual products.  
  - Larger rectangles represent higher sales or profit.  
  - Helps prioritize top-performing products and optimize inventory decisions.

- **4️⃣ Sales by Country and Discount Band (Horizontal Bar Chart):**  
  Breaks down **total sales per country**, segmented by **discount bands**.  
  - Highlights price sensitivity across countries.  
  - Supports decisions on regional discount and pricing strategies.


## 💡 Insights
- High-performing countries and products suggest opportunities for growth.  
- Some high-sales areas have low profit margins → potential inefficiencies.  
- Clusters respond differently to discounts, providing guidance for targeted promotions.  
- Interactive visualizations help stakeholders make data-driven decisions quickly.
